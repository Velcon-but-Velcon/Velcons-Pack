# Velcons-Pack
A texture files page, fo Minecraft. These are some of the texture packs I made and spliced together. These are all made for 1.8.9 but you can ask for a personal pack. If you want one you can dm me on Discord and tell me the packs you want. Example, you want a sword texture from one pack but everything else from another, tell me! The packs MUST be available on Curseforge.
